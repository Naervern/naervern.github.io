          <p>You, the commissioner, make a commission request explaining and detailing the idea to your taste.</p>
          <p>I’ll revise your request and upon approval, I ask for a downpayment of 20€ to begin design. This downpayment is to be discounted from the final price.</p>
          <p>During this stage, I will provide you draft previews of the work in progress as the idea is designed to your preference. If the commissioner opts for a change while in this stage, it shall be done free of charge unless it’s a drastic change from the initial request.</p>
          <p>Once the draft is approved, I will begin a more detailed sketch and keep you updated. From this point onwards, changes that require replacing elements of the art, changing poses or such may incur an added fee up to 20€. These fees for extra changes aren’t discounted from the final price.</p>
          <p>When the sketch is finished and approved, I will request half of the remaining payment for the commission to begin the lineart (or painting of shapes, if the commissioned format is Render/Digital Painting). I am only bound, free of charge, to do corrective small changes upon request.</p>
          <p>Once the art is finished, I will send a rescaled preview and request the remaining payment, and after that I will provide the full resolution PNG file, and if requested, a JPG/Jpeg compressed file, resized files, versions without background and even the Krita/CSP files (might not keep them for more than 60 days).</p>
